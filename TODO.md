#### Features - parity
- [x] Highlight line with error
- [ ] Read stdout/stderr on open (redirect stdout to log file?)


#### Features - desired
- [ ] Foldable sidebar with directory tree
- [ ] File Browser with connected file path
- [ ] Using signal/slot to redirect stream is slower than desirable
- [ ] Snippet file library
- [ ] Writing to external files instead of xml. Keeping those files in tab session until closed with a JSON file
